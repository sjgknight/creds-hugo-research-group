title: "CREDability talks 1: Secret Cyborgs in Education with Matt Esterman"
abstract: >-
  Matt will lead participants through an exploration of the nature and impact of
  AI in education. We will look at a range of case studies and practical
  examples for teachers to apply in their work, as well as discussing the larger
  educational opportunities and risks that AI presents to us. No prior knowledge
  is assumed, and all levels of technology capability are welcome! All you need
  is an open mind and a device to try out some of the ideas we discover.


  Matthew Esterman is a History teacher and Director of Innovation and Partnerships at Our Lady of Mercy College, Parramatta. He holds masters degrees from Macquarie University and the University of Sydney, and is the recipient of several awards, most recently the Commonwealth Bank Teaching Fellowship for 2023. His role involves establishing and maintaining valuable partnerships with external organisations such as universities, industry partners and charitable organisations, as well as seeking out and adopting innovative approaches to the school experience. Matthew has been a leading voice in the strategic and practical use of AI in schools, exploring the potential and pitfalls of various tools and platforms. Matthew recently launched the Mercy Multicredential initiative at OLMC, which allows students to curate a portfolio of evidence from across their school experience towards a nationally recognised, formal credential. He is a keen lifelong learner who believes we can bend the future using creativity, critical thinking, and compassion.
