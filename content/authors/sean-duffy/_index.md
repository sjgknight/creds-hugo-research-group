Sean Duffy is an educational technologist and founder exploring how we can better understand and evidence learning in digital environments. With over a decade of experience in learning design and educational technology at Griffith University, Sean has focused on developing solutions that make learning visible where it happens.

His work spans from early adaptive learning implementations to recent explorations of how we can simplify and enhance the learner experience in digital environments. At Griffith, Sean led several innovative projects including virtual field experiences and learning toolkits, earning recognition through the 2021 CAUDIT Award for Innovation in Teaching and Learning.

Currently, as co-founder of Stackle, Sean works with universities across Australia and internationally to transform how we capture evidence of learning in Canvas LMS. His approach combines learning design principles with practical technology implementation, focusing on how we can better understand student engagement and learning progression in digital environments.

Sean is particularly interested in how emerging technologies can be thoughtfully integrated into teaching practice to enhance rather than replace human connection in learning. His current research interests center on evidence-based approaches to learning design, student engagement in digital environments, and the meaningful integration of AI in education.
