With over 20 years of experience in the top-end hotel and gastronomy industry across five continents, and extensive roles in education and training since 2005, I have served as a lecturer, trainer, project manager, consultant, and program coordinator. My career includes senior executive positions at renowned 5-star hotels and teaching roles at institutions like William Angliss Institute Sydney and Le Cordon Bleu Ryde College. As a leading hospitality industry professional, MasterChef (ACF) and Certified Culinary Educator (WACS) bring comprehensive expertise in the Culinary Arts, Gastronomy,  Kitchen, Food & Beverage, and Hospitality management. I hold a Master of Education (Learning and Leadership), a Graduate Certificate in Learning Design, and a Bachelor of Education from the University of Technology Sydney. My innovative, progressive, evidence-based, and technology-driven learning design approach supports future-focused teaching and learning practices, contributing to the Continuous Professional Education and Development (CPED) of teachers, learners, and industry professionals. Passionate about guiding and nurturing the future of the hospitality industry, I aim to share my skills and knowledge to help individuals achieve their career aspirations.
