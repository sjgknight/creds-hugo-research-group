Camille is a Senior Lecturer in Higher Education Learning Design in the Faculty of Science. Camille researchers how individual differences (nee, cognitive constructs) influence learning and performance in online spaces.�To do this she traditionally uses usability study methods (Learning Experience design) to map and track learning behaviours with the intent of enhancing designs through the possible illumination of quality indicators in the online learning spaces. This work has great significance for research on contextualized learning environments where factors that influence how technology enhanced learning occurs are not always accommodated, referenced or thought of in the research designs.�Camille's work has made contributions to finding ways to improve the design of online learning environments for particular contexts, to support equitable learning despite different learning contexts. Camille has a BSc in Computer Science from the University of the West Indies, Trinidad;�obtained her MSc in Software Development and Management from Rochester Institution of Technology via an Organisation of American States Fellowship and obtained her PhD in Information Science and Learning Technologies via a Fulbright Scholarship to the University of Missouri, USA.
