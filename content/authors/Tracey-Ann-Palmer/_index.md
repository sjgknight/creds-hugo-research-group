Tracey-Ann Palmer BTeach, BSc(Hons), MBA, PhD is a lecturer and researcher in initial teacher education at UTS specialising in science education and educational psychology. She has worked in research science (biochemistry) and as a manager for two scientific personnel consultancies. She has experience in the finance industry in the areas of marketing, product management and project management.

She has also been involved in a number of research projects at the UTS aimed at enhancing the quality of primary and secondary science teaching in Australian schools.

Second is ScienceSing, a project to create song-based educational resources that engage children with science.

She has two daughters and loves to sing, dance salsa and paint watercolours.
