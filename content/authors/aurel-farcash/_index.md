Aurel Farcash is a PhD Candidate at the University of Technology Sydney, specializing in Responsible and Ethical AI. His research is a direct evolution of a 25-year career as a founder, MD, CEO, and strategic advisor within the Digital Infrastructure and Cloud Services sectors across APAC and EMEA. Currently serving as the Chief Revenue Officer at DXN, Aurel’s academic focus is driven by his "practical immersion" in the complexities of scaling digital ecosystems. He is moving the conversation beyond the theoretical "should" of AI toward a pragmatic "how", developing robust governance frameworks that ensure AI integration is both commercially viable and ethically grounded. Aurel’s work sits at the critical intersection of AI governance, ethics in education, and the digital society, with a focus on maintaining human-centric integrity in an automated world.
