Indra is an interdisciplinary researcher with project management experience in real-world applications of emerging technologies and customer relationship management and experience in conversational AI design, qualitative research, and design thinking. 

She holds professional experience as a data analyst and user experience delivery manager at Westpac Group. And as an academic librarian, AI designer, consultant, tutor, learning experience advisor, research assistant, editor and project officer at UTS.

Indra's current research takes a human-centred perspective on long-term users and their families' use of voice assistants. She uses embodied interaction to explore the first popular AI in homes, Alexa, Google and Siri, to uncover novel ways that users navigate space, place, fields, affordances, ecosystems, relationships, and culture. Her research has implications for spatial computing, human and AI relationships, and embodied, tangible and social interaction. Indra's work spans across human-computer interaction, human-computer relationships, human-robot interaction, sociology, media and communication, digital cultures, digital humanities, internet studies, science and technology studies and social computing.

Indra is currently wrapping up my PhD at UTS. She has held positions as the student representative for HDRs on the FASS faculty board (2020-2022), the alternate FASS representative on the Academic Board (2020-2021), and member of the UTS HDR working group. Indra was the FASS 1st place winner for the Three Minute Thesis competition in 2019 and 2021, and also won 2nd place in the Visualise Your Thesis competition in 2019.
