Dewi researches design processes and influences of Indonesian University English Teachers. Her research involves undertaking case studies remotely and digitally, deriving from several data collection techniques: document analysis, interviews, observations, teachers' subject planning documents, and participant diaries. Within the conceptual frame of Activity Theory and TPACK, these approaches allow for a rich data set to understand context and contributors to teachers' design work. Her research will provide a guide to teachers on how to design a blended and/or online learning subject for language learners and support policy makers re-drawing regulations regarding blended or online learning practices in higher education. Dewi works for the English Education Department of IAIN Salatiga, a government university in Central Java, Indonesia. Her research interests include technology-enhanced language learning, learning design, and teacher practice.
