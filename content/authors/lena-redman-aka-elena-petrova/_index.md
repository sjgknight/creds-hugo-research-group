Lena Redman is a Russian-born Australian educational researcher with a foundation in the visual arts and a deep commitment to learning as relational world-making. She graduated from Astrakhan Vlasov College of Arts and began her professional journey as a Visual Arts teacher in Ukraine. Her creative practice expanded in New Zealand, where she worked as an illustrator and graphic designer for leading educational publishers Macmillan and Reed.

After moving to Australia, Lena completed a Diploma of Secondary Education at Monash University and taught Visual Communication and Multimedia at Salesian and Haileybury Colleges. Concurrently, she pursued postgraduate studies at Monash, culminating in a PhD focused on multimodal and interdisciplinary knowledge production.

Lena’s work reimagines education through integrative, participatory, and *I-Do-Care* frameworks that foreground the interconnectedness of self and world. She is the designer of an emergent multimodal, interdisciplinary and participatory learning model now entering its pilot phase. Currently, she serves as a postdoctoral research fellow on the *Trustworthy Digital Society* project—a joint initiative between the University of Technology Sydney and the University of New South Wales—advancing inclusive, imaginative and safe educational futures.
