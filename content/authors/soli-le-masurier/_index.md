I currently work designing digital, virtual and blended learning experiences. I've spent several years at a global professional services firm where digital learning was built in authoring tools and delivered via a custom-built LXP to thousands of employees each year. Previously I studied and worked in chemical engineering and then science research during which I found my passion for higher education teaching and learning. Additionally, I have a great interest in using my own digital user experience to consider new ways of designing digital learning. I currently teach in the UTS Master of Education (Learning and Leadership) with a focus on digital learning and research practices.
