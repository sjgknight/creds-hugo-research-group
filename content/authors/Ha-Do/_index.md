Ha was a research student in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Ha's research aims to examine the effects of flipped instruction on EFL academic writing in a Vietnamese higher education context. A mixed-methods approach was employed with pre/post-questionnaires, class observations, teacher and student interviews, and writing pre/post-tests. This investigation of a relatively under-researched area of flipped studies in Vietnam should help practitioners to make more informed choices over whether and how to apply the method in their own teaching. Her other research interests lie in CALL, language testing and learning motivation.
