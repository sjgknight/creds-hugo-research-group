Dr. Janine Aldous Arantes is a researcher and educator at Victoria University, where she focuses on the intersection of digital education, AI governance, and the psychosocial risks associated with teaching. Her work is driven by a commitment to inclusivity and social justice, particularly in how technology impacts educational systems and teacher well-being. With a background in both teaching and research, Janine is deeply engaged in understanding how AI tools, like generative AI, are reshaping the landscape of education, often bringing attention to the risks they pose for teachers and students alike.

One of Janine's core areas of research involves exploring the psychosocial risks faced by pre-service teachers (PSTs) as they navigate the rapidly evolving digital environment. By examining how technologies like AI affect academic integrity and mental health, she provides insights into the challenges educators encounter in maintaining professional standards in the digital age. This work has become increasingly relevant as schools and universities across Australia integrate more AI-driven tools, prompting the need for deeper discussions around ethics, responsibility, and the well-being of both educators and learners.

Janineâ€™s research is also informed by her involvement in various international and national forums, where she contributes to dialogues on technology policy and education reform. Her contributions have helped shape discussions on how to protect educators' rights to a safe workplace, balancing innovation in teaching with the need for regulation and safeguarding teacher autonomy. Through these efforts, Janine has become a voice in advocating for greater protections and support for educators working within digitally-mediated environments. At Victoria University, Janine is known for her work with early career researchers, her leadership within the Institute for Sustainable and Liveable Cities, and her efforts in building inclusive, trauma-informed teaching practices. Her approach to education is both reflective and forward-thinking, consistently seeking ways to make digital education more equitable and responsive to the diverse needs of learners and educators alike.
