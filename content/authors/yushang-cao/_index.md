Yushang is a PhD candidate in Education. Her research explores the integration of digital technologies in educational contexts, with a particular focus on how teachers and students engage with these tools to enhance learning outcomes. Her current work delves into the role of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, in the feedback-giving process to support students in improving their writing skills, as well as how these tools influence the dynamics of feedback between teachers and students. Specifically, she aims to investigate how ChatGPT can provide individualised, instant feedback that complements teacher input, fostering a collaborative environment for knowledge construction. This work lies at the intersection of digital education, technology-enhanced learning, and writing pedagogy, contributing to the growing field of educational innovation through AI-driven tools.
