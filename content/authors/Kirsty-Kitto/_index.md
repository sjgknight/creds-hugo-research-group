Kirsty Kitto is an Associate Professor in the Connected Intelligence Centre, where she models the many ways in which humans interact with information, and how this can change as a result of the different contexts in which people find themselves. She is working towards providing unified mathematical and computational models of contextuality, which often results in apparently complex and unpredictable human behaviour. She publishes papers in journals covering fields such as Complex Systems Science, Cognitive Science, Psychology and Computer Science. Kirsty is an Associate Professor in the UTS Connected Intelligence Centre, which specialises in Educational Data Science and Human-Centred Design to develop interactive tools that help leaders, analysts, educators and students uncover new insights.
