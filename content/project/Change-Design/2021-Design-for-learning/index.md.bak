A body of our work has been on the design of learning environments to support learning, drawing on technology both in the design process, and to enhance the learning environments.

With colleagues Bennett (Wollongong), and Agostinho, Lockyer has developed a range of analyses of how teachers learn to design, and supports for this. You can find out more about these projects at the Learning Design Research site.
