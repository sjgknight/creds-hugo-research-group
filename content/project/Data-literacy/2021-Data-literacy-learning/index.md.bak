We have undertaken a number of projects around teacher data literacy and design for learning, and the idea of making learning visible. 

Much of this work is around how teachers (across sectors) think about the data they use in their practice, and what features of learning processes and products they would like insight into. The intent is not to assess data literacy, or to directly translate these discussions into products, but rather to explore the potential (and limitations) of data and technologies with teachers, to understand their practice and how data-informed technologies may support this. 

We have also used interviews to investigate the particular reasoning and design practices of instructors using learning analytics, and quasi-experimental methods with surveys and assessment outcomes to compare student outcomes in the context of different tools and designs for learning.
