summary: This study employs multi-level agent-based modeling and computational
  techniques to explore education as a complex system. With an underlying focus
  that education should be underpinned by a scientific understanding of student
  learning, we created computational models that simulated learning dynamics in
  classrooms, integrating both quantitative and qualitative insights. Through
  these models, we conducted experiments aligned with real classroom data to
  address key questions, such as “How can we effectively support the academic
  progress of underperforming students, who are disproportionately from low
  socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds, to close their multi-year achievement
  gap in mathematics?” Our study analyzes various instructional approaches for
  mathematical learning, and our findings highlight the potential effectiveness
  of Productive Failure as an instructional approach. Considerations of the
  broader applicability of computational methods in advancing educational
  research are also provided.
