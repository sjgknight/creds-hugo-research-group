CREDS held its first meeting for 2026 on 9 February 2026, bringing members together to reconnect after a challenging year and to set priorities for the year ahead. The meeting reaffirmed CREDS’ mission: to explore the dynamic relationship between technology and learning across formal, informal, and professional education contexts throughout the lifespan, with research that interrogates how technologies shape learning and what a digital society demands of education.  

### Reflections on 2025: momentum and meaningful partnerships

The meeting celebrated several highlights from 2025, including the Visiting Scholar program and the contribution of Associate Professor Simon Paxton, alongside the successful completion of projects under the CREDS umbrella. Members also reflected on outcomes from the Facebook Community Moderator Training work, and acknowledged a strong year for externally supported research projects, including: AI in Schools (Lead CI: Dr Damian Maher), Youth, Trust and Technology (Lead CI: Keith Heggart), and Building Tech Trust in Older Adults (Lead CI: Bhuva Narayan).  

### Research seminars: nominate speakers and share the mic

CREDS confirmed the continuation of its Research Seminar series in 2026, building on recent sessions. Members are invited to nominate speakers and propose sessions—particularly those showcasing works-in-progress, new collaborations, and emerging research methods.  

### CREDS Research Sprint Grants open in March

A key announcement for 2026 is the return of the CREDS Research Sprint Grants, with approximately $20,000 total funding available this year. Individual grants of up to $7,000 will be available for research purposes (not teaching release). Applications must include at least one CREDS full member on the team.

Key dates

* Grants open: 3 March
* Applications close: 17 March
* Outcomes announced: 24 March  

Details will be circulated to members via email.

### Membership update: help keep CREDS current


To ensure the CREDS community remains active and accurately represented, members will shortly receive a membership update form. Completing the form will help maintain an up-to-date membership list and support planning for events, grants, and communications.  

### Help us tell the CREDS story

The meeting closed with a call for members to share achievements and opportunities so CREDS can amplify them through the website and LinkedIn: new publications, grants, projects, partnerships, student successes, and upcoming talks are all welcome. Members are also encouraged to attend CREDS webinars—and, even better, to present at one—and to follow the CREDS LinkedIn page
