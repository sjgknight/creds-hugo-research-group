summary: >-
  Democratic education remains a contentious and much strived for goal within
  teaching practice. What is most often lacking are the precise tools and
  techniques that might be combined to make this democratic goal a reality
  within schools. Considerations of democratic approaches to education within
  the literature are frequently theoretical, but practically quite limited.
  Moving from a highly theoretical space to a practical approach ready to be
  applied within a modern classroom, this paper will explore a confluence of
  teaching approaches that might make democratic education possible. The
  techniques, tools and platforms provided for consideration by teachers and
  lecturers here are grouped around three core themes: accessibility; relevance
  and efficiency to generate and allow a space that is democratic in nature. The
  tools for accessibility are: Instructional Video; Assistive technologies; and
  Generative Artificial Intelligence. Whilst for relevance: YouTube and TikTok
  are explored. In regards to efficiency: Flipped Learning, Retrieval practice
  and Method of Loci are discussed. And when honing in on the democratic nature
  of classroom spaces Socratic circles and a broadly Socratic approach are key.
  By combining these techniques this paper will propose a highly practical,
  modern method for producing a democratic classroom, with notes on how teachers
  might be able to carve out space and thinking to defend their choices and the
  logic behind combining these techniques to address modern students' needs and
  requirements.
