In the fifth instalment of the CREDS seminar series, Dr Jorge Reyna delivered a compelling presentation on an innovative, evidence-based curriculum co-designed with six Australian and New Zealand medical colleges. Moving beyond the familiar terrain of higher education, Raine showcased how rigorous learning design, cross-institutional collaboration, and scenario-based learning can transform supervisor training in medical education.

The *Medical Supervisor Curriculum (MSC)* responds to a clear and urgent need: to standardise supervisory practice across diverse clinical specialties while embedding cultural safety throughout. Notably, the project refrains from isolating cultural safety as a standalone module—instead, it is embedded across all seven core capabilities. This approach, praised by Indigenous scholar Professor James Parajuli, offers a valuable blueprint for other education sectors grappling with how to meaningfully address diversity and inclusion.

The presentation highlighted the project’s methodical process: an in-depth analysis of supervision roles across 16 colleges, a validated survey with 177 medical supervisors, and a co-designed curriculum grounded in both quantitative and qualitative data. Particularly striking was Raine’s insistence on simplicity and practicality: learning materials were delivered via *Visme*, a cost-effective platform, using scenario-based microlearning modules. These resources prioritised authenticity, learner voice, and well-being—elements often overlooked in university contexts.

For learning designers in higher education, this project is a reminder that curriculum design doesn’t begin with learning outcomes—it begins with listening. It also challenges universities to reimagine their digital learning practices, not as one-size-fits-all, but as flexible, evidence-based, and culturally aware.

In a time of escalating pressures in both health and education sectors, the MSC model offers a replicable, values-driven framework—one that merges research and practice with clarity and care.
