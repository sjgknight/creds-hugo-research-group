You've probably all seen books about Generative AI - but what about a book written by AI? Well, that's sort of what Keith Heggart has been working on lately. Working with the academic publishers at Springer, Keith has used Machine Learning to create a book 'An introduction to civics and citizenship education'. The book is made up of some machine-learning generated summaries of articles on various topics related to the central them. Keith curated the articles, and wrote the introduction and conclusion. Keith has blogged about this process here: https://lnkd.in/gFdXtBGm
