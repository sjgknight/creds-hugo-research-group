CREDS members recently led papers appearing in the special issue of the *Irish Educational Studies* on the topic of digital education futures (see [https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ries20/current](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ries20/current "https\://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ries20/current") ). 

[Matthew Kearney](https://creds.netlify.app/author/matthew-kearney/) and [Sandy Schuck](https://creds.netlify.app/author/sandra-schuck/) co-authored a paper with Kevin Burden (Uni of Hull, UK). They used evidence from their recent study of Australian schools to develop and discuss four futures education scenarios. The paper aims to help educators consider future teaching, and to provoke discussion of inclusion and innovation in future school education.

[Lauren Knussen](https://creds.netlify.app/author/lauren-knussen/) co-authored a paper with Annie Agnew (Uni of Notre Dame, Sydney), reporting on a study exploring graduate teacher experiences of in-school support for technology-enabled learning. They argue for an innovative approach to mentorship which supports the development of early career teachers’ digital agency.
