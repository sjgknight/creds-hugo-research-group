The meeting was focused on the first CREDS research speed dating event, aimed at fostering connections and collaboration among researchers in the field of education in a digital society.

Keith discussed the CREDS research sprint grants, which offer $20,000 annually for small seed grants to support research projects, requiring at least two CREDS members, one of whom must be a full member employed at UTS.Â 

Damian proposed research on the use of AI to support student learning in schools, building on previous research with teachers and emphasizing the diverse research team involved.

Amara introduced her idea of using open educational resources and microlearning to create accessible learning opportunities, focusing on adaptive learning systems and learner agency.

Simon's pitch addressed the evolving role of learning designers in higher education, exploring career trajectories and challenges faced due to emerging technologies like AI.

Spice shared a project idea investigating the impact of generative AI on international PhD students, particularly those for whom English is a second language, focusing on mental well-being and academic skills.

Nhung proposed research on leveraging generative AI for learning design, examining its benefits, drawbacks, and ethical considerations in Australia and New Zealand.

Camille discussed her research on cognitive constructs influencing learning flow, emphasizing the need to understand individual differences in digital learning environments.

Gary pitched his startup, Bloom AI, which focuses on using AI tutors in education, particularly in girls' schools, to research the effects of generative AI on student outcomes.

Suzana presented two project ideas: developing an app or AI tool for adolescent recreational substance use and a program for transliterating reading skills across different platforms.

Janine highlighted her project on the impact of emergent technologies on teachers' mental health and workplace rights, aiming to develop case studies for teacher education programs.

John shared his broad interests in digital technology and education, including the need to rethink 21st-century skills and the role of student questioning in learning.

Keith encouraged participants to apply for CREDS research sprint funding and promised to share further details about the application process.
