Recently, Dr Sophie Fenton (Amicus), presented the first CREDability Talk. Her topic was human education for a generative AI world, and she drew on her own research in establishing a school and leading both education and workplaces. Much of her focus was on generative AI, but Dr Fenton contextualised the current emphasis within the broader scope of paradigms, megatrends and thought movements. One aspect that was particularly insightful was her discussion of the fact that we're not simply using these tools, as we might have used educational technology in the past, but we're actually in a relationship with these smart machines. 

Our next CREDability talk will be with Dr Leon Furze, in July.
