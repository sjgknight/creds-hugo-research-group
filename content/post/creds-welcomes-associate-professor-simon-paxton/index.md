The Centre for Research on Education in a Digital Society (CREDS) is delighted to welcome Associate Professor Simon Regin Paxton as a visiting scholar.


Dr. Paxton is an Associate Professor in the Department of English at Komazawa University in Tokyo, Japan. With a rich and varied research background spanning Japanese Studies, language education, and learning design, his work reflects a deep engagement with both traditional and contemporary aspects of Japanese culture and education. His interests range from kanji acquisition among non-kanji background learners and traditional Japanese conjuring to the aesthetics of Japanese stone gardens.

In recent years, Dr. Paxtonâ€™s focus has shifted towards learning design and online learning in higher education. At CREDS, he is deepening his exploration of the evolving role of learning designers and the future of digital education. His visit will further our shared interest in advancing innovative, inclusive, and impactful learning design practices, and he welcomes opportunities for collaboration in these areas.

Originally from Brisbane and now based in Tokyo for over two decades, Dr. Paxton brings a unique international perspective to our research community. We are thrilled to have him with us and look forward to the insights and connections that will emerge from his time at CREDS.
