Last week, CREDS members had the chance to listen to Dr Bhuva Narayan and Indra Mckie as they discussed their ongoing research project that is exploring the potential role of voice assistants in children's learning. 

This was a small scale research project, funded by the CREDS research sprint grants, with the aim of having some research outcomes delivered within 12 months. 

The purpose of the research check in was to provide an update of the project thus far, and to also provide a space for a collegial discussion that might offer new insights or help to resolve any challenges that the researchers are facing. In this case, the challenge included getting access to schools and young people to undertake this kind of research.
