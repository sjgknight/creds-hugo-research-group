Recently, CREDS members had the chance to listen to Leon Furze discuss the recent advances in GenAI and how they might affect education. Leon is currently undertaking his PhD at Deakin University in exactly this field, and has become well known for the generous and insightful commentary he provides on this topic. 

The presentation was wide-ranging and informative, exploring the different kids of GenAI tools available for educators, including sound, audio and text generation. There was also a brief discussion of the technical underpinnings of GenAI tools. However, the most impressive aspect was when Leon combined all of the various tools into two short learning videos - one on the structure of a leaf, and one on Gothic architecture. While they were not perfect (but what teacher-made assets ever are?), the fact that these video assets were pulled together in less than 10 minutes was startling, and really showcased the potential of GenAI tools - but also some of the danger, too, because surely it is only a matter of time until such assets become commonplace? 

This raises all sorts of questions beyond the concern about assessment that has dominated much of the discussion related to GenAI. 

*This was part of the CREDAbility Talks sessions for CREDS.*
