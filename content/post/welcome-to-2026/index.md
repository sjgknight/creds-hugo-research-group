Welcome to the Centre for Research on Education in a Digital Society (CREDS). We bring together researchers, educators, and partners who are interested in how technology is shaping learning, teaching, and participation in education across the lifespan.

As we begin 2026, CREDS is focused on building momentum through connection, collaboration, and practical opportunities to turn ideas into research and impact. Across the year we’ll be running CREDS Research Sprints Grants, designed to help members develop new projects, strengthen partnerships, and move promising work forward. We’ll also be hosting the CREDS Seminar Series, showcasing emerging research, sharing methods and insights, and creating space for discussion across disciplines and practice contexts.

CREDS is also a network—so this is a chance to reconnect with existing collaborators, meet new ones, and help shape our priorities for the year ahead. Keep an eye on this site for updates on grant rounds, seminar dates, and other events, and opportunities to participate in (and lead) CREDS activity throughout 2026.
