Our congratulations to [Mary Coupland]({{< relref "/authors/Mary-Coupland" >}}) who led a successful UTS Team Teaching award for her work with a team (including [Simon Knight]({{< relref "/authors/Simon-Knight" >}})) on developing quantitative literacy and critical thinking.

The award reflects five years of development of an undergraduate cross-faculty elective subject ‘Arguments, Evidence, and Intuition’. The subject aims to address issues such as how we support students to critique data in the news, identify poor use or absence of data in political decisions, and think about how data might inform their own personal, professional, and civic decision making. It is taught by a range of academics across UTS faculties, similarly supporting students across faculties to develop these critical capacities for their professional development, recognising the need for people across professions to work effectively with data.

Teaching in the subject has drawn on the team’s interdisciplinary expertise, making use of technology to support learning and develop skills in communicating and critiquing data, and working with every day statistics using real examples from health, business, sports, and more.

If you’re interested in researching development of data and quantitative skills, get in touch.

Well done to the whole team!
