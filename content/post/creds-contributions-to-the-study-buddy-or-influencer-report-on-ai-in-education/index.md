The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a significant turning point for the Australian education system, and the Study Buddy or Influencer report, published in August 2024 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education, and Training, provides comprehensive insights into this evolving landscape. The Centre for Research on Education in a Digital Society (CREDS) played a vital role in shaping the dialogue and outcomes of this inquiry. Here’s a summary of the report and the contributions CREDS made to this important work.

**Understanding GenAI in Education**

The report highlights the increasing presence of GenAI tools in Australian education, addressing their potential to enhance learning through personalized experiences, streamline administrative tasks, and alleviate teacher workloads. However, it also underscores concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the risk of over-reliance on AI technologies. With countries like Singapore and Finland leading the charge in integrating AI into their curricula, the report stresses the need for Australia to adopt a strategic and balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of AI while safeguarding students and educators.

**CREDS’ Involvement and Contributions**

CREDS has been pivotal in advancing discussions around the ethical use of technology in education, contributing to the inquiry by providing expert insights into the safe and responsible integration of AI tools. Associate Professor Julia Powles from CREDS was a key member of the inquiry’s expert panel. Powles brought a critical perspective to the potential and challenges of GenAI, advocating for its ethical use and stressing the importance of strong guidelines to avoid exacerbating inequities in education. Her expertise helped shape the report’s recommendations on data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and equity of access to AI tools.

Additionally, CREDS’ ongoing research into digital literacy informed the report’s call for robust AI literacy programs across all levels of education. The report reflects CREDS’ emphasis on the need for teachers to receive ongoing professional development to equip them with the skills to integrate AI effectively into their teaching practices. The Centre’s work on fostering responsible digital citizenship and media literacy was also reflected in recommendations surrounding the use of AI to combat misinformation and disinformation.

**Key Recommendations Influenced by CREDS**

Several key recommendations in the report were shaped by CREDS’ research and advocacy. The report calls for the Australian Government to make GenAI in education a national priority, ensure that AI tools are inclusive and representative of Australia’s diverse communities, and that safeguards are in place, particularly for vulnerable student cohorts. Furthermore, CREDS’ push for a framework that ensures the ethical development and deployment of AI tools in schools contributed to the development of the Australian Framework for Generative AI in Schools. This framework aims to provide clear guidelines for educators, parents, and policymakers on the use of AI in education.

**Looking Ahead**

The Study Buddy or Influencer report provides a roadmap for the future of AI in Australian education, with CREDS playing an integral role in ensuring that this future is built on principles of equity, safety, and inclusivity. As Australia moves towards greater integration of AI in classrooms, CREDS’ continued research and thought leadership will be essential in guiding educators, policymakers, and students towards a balanced and ethical use of AI technologies.

**Conclusion**

The Study Buddy or Influencer report is a landmark document in Australia’s journey towards integrating AI into its education system. Through the expert contributions of CREDS, the report presents a vision where AI is a tool for empowerment rather than a source of inequality, ensuring that the future of education in Australia is inclusive, safe, and driven by ethical considerations.
