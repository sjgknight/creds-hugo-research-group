At the latest CREDS (Centre for Research on Education in a Digital Society) seminar, educators and researchers came together to explore how Australian schools are navigating the complex and fast-moving world of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Held virtually, the event was hosted by Dr. Keith Heggart, Director of CREDS, and featured a keynote presentation by Dr. Suzana Sukovic from PLC Sydney.

Dr. Sukovic shared findings from her year-long research project on the use of generative AI in primary and secondary school settings. The project, which began in March 2023, aimed to give schools practical, evidence-based insights to inform policy and practice. “It’s really a snapshot in time,” she explained, “but one that reveals the trajectory schools are taking and the questions we need to ask ourselves.”

Through interviews, focus groups, and professional development observations, the study revealed five broad approaches to AI adoption in schools—from cautious planning and policy writing to enthusiastic, unstructured use at the grassroots level. Interestingly, only a few schools had fully structured strategies, while many were still testing the waters.

Dr. Sukovic highlighted how AI is already supporting teachers in unexpected ways—from writing reports and lesson plans to helping craft sensitive communications with parents. “Some teachers see AI as a kind of emotional support,” she noted, describing it as a digital ‘buddy’ when crafting challenging messages. Other practical uses include differentiating learning materials, generating quizzes, and creating adaptive learning experiences.

However, concerns remain, particularly around assessment integrity, research skills, and the potential for “beige writing” when students overly rely on AI. One teacher used AI to generate test questions from student essays to assess understanding. Others encouraged journaling and process-based assessment models to support authentic learning.

Primary schools, often overlooked in AI conversations, also featured prominently. At several schools, even kindergarten students were engaging with AI tools—with teachers guiding them through ethical use, prompting skills, and basic AI literacy. One class, for example, held a conversation with an AI-generated version of Captain Cook to explore historical perspectives and trustworthiness of sources.

Dr. Sukovic emphasized that teacher librarians and information specialists play a crucial role in supporting AI literacy across the curriculum—something that schools must recognize as they evolve digital citizenship frameworks.

Discussion also turned to AI’s impact on student wellbeing. Teachers observed that while students often use AI collaboratively, some are replacing social interaction with AI chat tools. Participants debated whether schools should develop scaffolded wellbeing tools powered by AI, like university-targeted self-care apps, while emphasizing the need for human intervention where necessary.

The seminar concluded with an open discussion on the foundational skills needed in an AI-saturated world. While critical thinking, empathy, and content knowledge remain essential, participants acknowledged that what counts as “foundational” may need to shift.
