CREDS is excited to see that Associate Professor Heather Ford has won an ARC Future Fellowship Grant. These are amongst the most prestigious fellowships and serves to recognise Professor Ford's scholarship. We extend our warmest congratulations to her for this incredible achievement, and look forward to helping to share the research she produces during the Fellowship. 

More details on her applicaiton:

Australians use AI answer systems embedded in virtual assistants, smart speakers and chatbots that offer “fast facts” in many quotidian contexts. But Siri, Alexa and ChatGPT provide information that is often biased, sometimes inaccurate, and almost always stripped of its human origins. Citizens display misplaced trust in systems which seem to rise above human biases to offer an apparently omniscient, neutral perspective. This project aims to “reclaim the human” in AI answer systems by mapping how knowledges are coproduced by people at multiple levels of the AI model lifecycle, collaboratively reimagining how AI answer systems might be designed differently and using the redesigned products to catalyse critical AI literacy.
